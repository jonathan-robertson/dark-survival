## Acknowledgements

This mod as it's currently written is only possible due to the brilliant efforts of another modder and his willingness to share what he learned:

**Doughphunghus** developed the [Dark Indoors](https://7daystodiemods.com/dark-indoors/) mod for A20/A21 which adjusted light levels. I then further adjusted the lighting levels to balance them with 7DTD 1.2 in a way that felt right to me.
